**Purpose** – Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) is a notable invention introduced in the biomedical industry. It provides valuable information
about intermittent capillary blood glucose that is normally unattainable by regular clinical blood sample tests. CGM includes several progressive
facilities such as instantaneous and real-time display of blood glucose level, “24/7” coverage, continuous motion of alerts for actual or impending
hypo- and hyperglycemia and the ability to characterize glycemic variability. CGM allows users and physicians to visualize and diagnose more
accurate and precise rate of change of glucose by capacitating small, comfortable, user-friendly sensor devices. Sometimes, this vital information is
shared to the personal message box over Internet. In short, CGM is capable to inform, educate, motivate and alert (IEMA) people with diabetes.
Despite the huge expectation with CGM, the available solutions have not attracted much attention among people. The huge potential of CGM in
future diabetic study relies on the successful implication of the CGM. This paper aims at disseminating of state-of-the-art knowledge about existing
work around the CGM.
**Design/methodology/approach** – This paper presents a comprehensive systematic review on the recent developments in CGM development
techniques that have been reported in credible sources, namely PubMed, IEEE Xplore, Science Direct, Springer Link, Scopus and Google
Scholar. Detailed analysis and systematic comparison are provided to highlight the achievement and future direction of CGM deployment.
**Findings** – Several key challenges are also portrayed for suitable opportunistic orientation. CGM solutions from four leading manufacturers such as
Tandem, Dexcom, Abbott and Medtronic are compared based on the following factors including accuracy (% MARD); sensor lifetime, calibration
requirement, smart device, compatibility and remote monitoring. Qualitative and quantitative analyses are performed.
**Originality/value** – This work can be a valuable source of reference and guidance for future research in this field.

CGM systems have attracted great attention in terms of
scientific and clinical advances, among its users worldwide.
This paper presents such systems, first by comparing the
available products in market and then reviewing sensor
design-specific studies from 29 research articles.
Development of the CGM systems has yielded three key
solutions: optical, electrochemical and MEMS. Several
challenges toward the usage of the CGM systems persist,
but are being sincerely examined. The mind-set of the
physicians and their approach to cooperate with the patients
is the major challenge in this regard. Similarly, lack of
awareness and related education is the key problem among
users. The advancement in sensor accuracy and calibration
may take CGM systems a step forward in curing and treating
diabetes from the world.
